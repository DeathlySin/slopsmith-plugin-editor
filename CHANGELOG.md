# Changelog

All notable changes to the Arrangement Editor plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **Drum vocab expanded to 18 pieces.** The drum editor's lane grid now
  shows the new `stack` (between Crash R and HH Open) and `bell` (after
  R.Bell) lanes from core's expanded PIECES dict. The existing
  `ride_bell` label is shortened to `R.Bell` to disambiguate from the
  new dedicated `bell` (bell cymbal) piece. Requires slopsmith core
  ≥ 0.2.9-alpha.4 for the new piece-ids.
- **Drum import — unmapped-notes warning + manual mapping.** When you
  import a GP or MIDI drum track containing percussion that doesn't map
  to one of the 18 slopsmith drum pieces (cowbell, tambourine, etc.),
  a dialog now lists the unmapped MIDI notes (with their GM names + hit
  counts) and lets you either drop them or pick a drum piece per row.
  Previously these notes were silently dropped on import. The
  `import-drums-tab` and `import-drums-midi` endpoints surface them via
  a new `unmapped: [{midi, count, times}]` field; the editor builds the
  warning + mapping UI client-side.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- The sync **offset** now also shifts `drum_tab` hits. Previously an
  offset nudge moved the guitar notes, beat grid and sections but left
  the drum chart behind, so drums ended up out of sync. Shifted hits
  are clamped at 0 and rounded to 3 dp.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Tempo Map editor** — an EOF-style mode for fitting the song-wide beat
  grid to the audio. A new **🎵 Tempo Map** toolbar button (works on both
  sloppak and PSARC) swaps the canvas to a tempo view: the waveform plus a
  draggable vertical "sync-point" pole at every measure downbeat, with each
  measure's BPM and time signature derived from sync-point spacing.
  - **Drag** a sync point to retime — only the two adjacent measures
    recompute their BPM; every other measure stays put.
  - **Insert / delete** sync points (right-click menu, or the Insert /
    Delete keys) to split or merge measures.
  - **Time signature** — `[` / `]` (or the right-click menu) change the
    selected measure's beats-per-measure; the interior grid re-subdivides.
  - **Notes ride the grid** with a user-selectable scope: a "Notes that
    ride the grid" toggle chooses **Drum tab only** (default — never
    disturbs a guitar/bass/keys chart) or **All instruments** (full
    retempo). The beat grid and section markers always move regardless.
    The choice persists in `localStorage`.
  - A dimmed reference layer shows the current arrangement's notes and the
    drum-tab hits at their absolute times, so the grid can be aligned to
    them and the waveform.
  - Every edit is a single undo step (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
